The Graphics and OpenGL.
</font>
</div>
<p>This page contains two applications written on Visual C++ 6.0 as well as some samples 
of graphic files.
</p>
<p>
<A href="graphviewer3_2.zip" > GraphViewer</a> is an application for viewing graphic 
files written in a special format (*.gra) for OpenGL. 
<br>Version history:
<br>10 Nov 2002 GraphViewer 2.0 - first public version,
<br>22 Mar 2003 GraphViewer 3.0 - added control buttons,
<br>21 Jun 2003 GraphViewer 3.1 - added saving to C++ file.
<br>24 Jan 2004 GraphViewer 3.2 - for dynamic files the opportunity of advance, back and a pause has appeared.
<br>Also you could download an <A href="graphviewer3_2exe.zip" >exe-file</a> of the program. 
</p>
<p>
<A href="graphmaker2.zip" >GraphMaker</a> is not a real "maker", 
but only an application by means of which I created the samples below. 
The GraphMaker itself doesn’t have any value here, and serves as a model 
to create gra-files. 
There is FileWriter class, which performs record files on a disk in a gra-format.

The description of a gra-format.
</font>
</div>
<p>By using conventional notation this format could be represented as the following:
</p>
<pre>
struct GraFormat
{
    unsigned int flags;
    unsigned int size;
    char comment[size];
    unsigned int version;
    unsigned int data[];
};
</pre>
<p>
<font color=blue>flags</font> declares a 4-byte integer intended for 32 one-bit flags. 
While only the zero bit is involved which informs, that one byte stands for symbol (0) 
or two bytes are for symbol (1) in the commentary. 
Other flags must be equal to zero.</p>
<p>
<font color=blue>size</font> declares a 4-byte integer and is equal to the quantity 
of bytes in the commentary. 
If the commentary is absent the integer is equal to 0.</p>
<p>
<font color=blue>comment</font> declares the commentary itself. </p>
<p>
<font color=blue>version</font> declares the 4-byte integer equal to the version of 
GraphicInterface class. </p>
<p>
<font color=blue>data</font> declares the data which represent coded OpenGL commands 
and some others.
