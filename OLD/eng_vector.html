Vectors.

</div>
<p>I think a lot of software developers once exercised own 3D-vector implementation.
There is also my implementation on the subject. Here I would like to provide a reader 
with a rationale as well as share some ideas with the reader about why the implementation 
has been done by the particular way described below, not somehow else. </p>
<pre>
class Vector3d
{
public :
    double x, y, z;
    Vector3d () {}
    Vector3d ( double a, double b, double c ) : x ( a ), y ( b ), z ( c ) {}
 
    Vector3d operator - () const
    {
        return Vector3d ( - x, - y, - z );
    }
 
    Vector3d &amp; operator += ( const Vector3d &amp; v )
    {
        x += v.x;
        y += v.y;
        z += v.z;
        return * this;
    }

    Vector3d &amp; operator -= ( const Vector3d &amp; v )
    {
        x -= v.x;
        y -= v.y;
        z -= v.z;
        return * this;
    }

    Vector3d &amp; operator *= ( const double d )
    {
        x *= d;
        y *= d;
        z *= d;
        return * this;
    }

    Vector3d &amp; operator /= ( const double d )
    {
        x /= d;
        y /= d;
        z /= d;
        return * this;
    }

    Vector3d &amp; null ()
    {
        x = y = z = 0.;
        return * this;
    }

    bool operator ! () const
    {
        return !x &amp;&amp; !y &amp;&amp; !z;
    }

    Vector3d &amp; norm ( double d = 1. );
    Vector3d   perpendicular () const;

<p>Let’s start from naming. As you could see I use capital letters for names 
of the object classes, but for function ones I do lowercase letters. I never 
use prefixes, such as MicroSoft and others. Since I operate <font color=blue>2d, 3f, 3i,</font> etc. 
the <font color=blue>3d (double)</font> notation has been applied to distinguish the particular vector. 
The template using seems to me less elegant. Besides, different classes have 
different interfaces. </p>
<p>Let’s go further. Why class has been used, not sructure. 
I think the idea proposed by Straustrup to practically put the same meaning 
for both of class and structure is not perfect. If a new term has to be created 
then old one should remain. That’s why I apply the struct, when there are no 
function-operand inside, otherwise I do class.
</p>
<p>Probably many of you will agree with x, y, z notation for data-operand, 
though there are other options.  </p>
<p>Constructor without parameters (no-parameter-constructor) doesn’t initialized data. 
I have noted, some developers initialize data by 0, but from my standpoint it is 
an extra meaningless work I recognized the modern computers are extremely fast, 
but if there is something you don’t have to perform, just don’t do it.
Copy constructor as well as assignment operator are redundant here since 
compiler generates the same by default. </p>
<p>Unary negate as well as several mentioned functions returns a nonconstant value, 
although there other recommendations I have read. It has been done by this way to 
provide with a capability to apply a function to the returned value, which could 
modify the value. For example, I can to write:
</p>
<pre>
const Vector3d v3 = ( v1 - v2 ).norm();
</pre>
<p><font color=blue>+=, -=.</font> All is clear here. </p>
<p><font color=blue>*=, /=.</font> Some time ago I had a constant reference on double and later on when 
I was trying to divide each vector term on x the error occurred. After the first 
attempt to divide the x became 1 and further dividing brought nothing. 
When I sorted out the problem I had to remove the reference.  
The similar fault I discovered on "XaOs OpenGL Pages" website. </p>
<p><font color=blue>null</font> function transforms a vector to null-vector. 
Also I am familiar with <font color=blue>Zero</font> notation for the function. </p>
<p>!-operator for vector manipulation performs the same that it does for quantity one, 
i.e. <font color=blue>if(!v)</font> is performed for null-vector, but the <font color=blue>if(!!v)</font> is executed for others. 
Some folks utilize !-operator to denote vector length. People needed a unary operator 
and they took this one. But I have decided to keep its original meaning. </p>
<p><font color=blue>norm</font> function transforms a given vector to a vector with a specified length 
(the unit length vector by default) and with the same vector magnitude. I am familiar 
with a variant of the function (having a different name), which doesn’t change 
the original vector, but returns a new one. I have preferred <font color=blue>norm</font> function, 
because more often I have exercised to normalize a given vector than create a new one. 
This function is first from described ones, which is not inline. Actually the function 
is simple and could be such it is, but this case the sqrt needs to be declared, 
what is not my programming style (I don’t use #include in header files). </p>
<p><font color=blue>perpendicular</font> function returns the unit length vector which is a perpendicular 
to the transformed one. In fact, there is infinite number of the vectors. 
Below is just one of them. I have never seen anyone uses the function like this one 
so the function has been created by myself, because I really needed it.  </p>

   Implementation of addition and subtraction for two vectors, 
and of multiplication (on both of sides of a math expression) as well as 
implementation of division (from one side) on a quantity are never
subjects of debates. Unlike the above mentioned the implementation of cross product and 
dot product is a different business. There are a lot of options to choose from. 
I am familiar with usage of <font color=blue>&amp;,|, ^</font> symbols  in vector manipulation expressions as 
well as with a number of different function names. My
approach is to practice the “*” notation to get a dot product and do “%”  notation to 
denote cross product. In math ( please note, vector manipulation is, first and foremost, 
mathematics, and then programming ) the dot product is denoted in the same way 
as the multiplication symbol (i.e. dot is a symbol of multiplication). Since 
in C++ programming language ( as well as in other programming languages ) the 
“*” is the symbol of multiplication the symbol has been chosen by me to use it in 
appropriate expressions to get the dot product. 
In math two cross slash is the symbol in vector manipulation expression which is 
intended to get the cross product. So the “%” symbol has been chosen to obtain the 
cross product. There is one slash in the symbol and two small zeroes that 
symbolize the latter one. Another advantage of the introduced symbols versus <font color=blue>&amp;,|, ^</font> symbols 
is priority of performance. In expressions like <font color=blue>v1*v2 + v3*v4</font> the parentheses are 
not needed, but <font color=blue>&amp;, |, ^</font> operations have lower priority 
than + operation and therefore, the parentheses are required. Not only is this 
inconvenient, but it also contradicts to math notation. 
Hope I have convinced someone.</p>
<p>
<font color=blue>qmod</font> function returns squared vector length.
Some of developers utilize <font color=blue>length</font> function, but the function 
calls <font color=blue>sqrt</font>, 
so I prefer to avoid this. Often knowing of the squared absolute value of a vector 
is more than enough. For example, if you need to know the longer of two vector lengths. 
When I simply need to know the length of a vector I use <font color=blue>sqrt(qmod(...))</font>. 
You could ask me why I have used this particular function. Well, you see 
<font color=blue>v*v</font> might be used instead of <font color=blue>qmod(v)</font>. 
So indeed, I do that for the trivial case 
(only for a vector, not for an expression), otherwise I use the approach described 
above.</p>
<p>
Concerning <font color=blue>==</font> and <font color=blue>!=</font>  
  operators the following
could be stated. These operators require the right usage. Values with “double” type could 
be slightly different for some reasons so consequently there is no need to 
compare. On the other hand, if it is known that vectors have specified values, 
then the comparison makes sense. </p>
<p>
<font color=blue>reper</font> function transforms a vector (first parameter) 
to two perpendicular vectors, i.e. we obtain the right-handed coordinate system. 
If the first vector has unit length then the two resulting vectors will be  
the same. </p>
<p>Now let’s talk about the reason for which I didn’t describe some 
functions, that might be utilized in other implementations. There are other specific 
multiplication and division operations, which are analogs of addition and subtraction. 
I have never needed the operations during my ten years’ experience in the geometric 
programming field. There are no operations such as these in math either. 
For the same reason there are no calls to vector components using indexes.</p>
